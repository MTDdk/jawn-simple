# Simple example usage of [jawn](https://github.com/MTDdk/jawn)

> Bear in mind that jawn is currently under heavy development and refactoring, so this example usage may not be updated to use the latest version of jawn. When a stable version of jawn is done, then this example will start to reflect the most current release.

* This example uses [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) as build system, but this project includes a wrapper for Gradle,
so it is not necessary to have it installed on your system.

* Run the application with Gradle already installed:
```
gradle jettyrun
```
* Run the application with Gradle NOT installed:
```
[*NIX]:    ./gradlew jettyrun
[Windows]: gradlew.bat jettyrun
```


* Browse to:
```
http://localhost:8080/
```
